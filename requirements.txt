# Universal Deep Research - Minimal Dependencies
# Core functionality requirements only

# Standard library modules used:
# - datetime, json, re, math, ast, time, signal, contextlib
# - unittest, sys, io, urllib.parse, abc, typing
# - No external dependencies required for basic functionality

# Optional dependencies for production use:
# Uncomment and install as needed for specific backends

# For OpenAI LLM integration:
# openai>=1.0.0

# For web requests (Brave Search API):
# requests>=2.25.0

# For development and testing:
# pytest>=6.0.0
# pytest-cov>=2.10.0

# Note: The system is designed to work with mock implementations
# by default, requiring no external dependencies for testing
# and development. Install optional dependencies only when
# integrating with real LLM and search services.
